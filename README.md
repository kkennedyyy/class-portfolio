CSCE 146 Algorithmic Design II w JJ:  
Lab 00 Objective: Implement bubble sort for an array of integers by following the instructions.  
Lab 01 Objective: Write a program that analyzes a collection of words and sorts them in ascending order by the number of vowels, consonants, and the length of the word.  
Lab 02 Objective: Write a solution that performs file input and output (File I/O) using a variety of file types and problems.  
Lab 03 Objective: Implement a system that keeps tracks of groceries in a singly linked-list.  
Lab 04 Objective: Write a doubly linked list of type double.  This link list is similar to the singly linked list except that each node in addition to having data and a next link it now has a previous link.   
Lab 05 Objective: Write a program which simulates first come first serve process scheduling using a queue.  

Homework 00 Objective: Write a program that performs a variety of vector math operations. These operations include adding vectors, subtracting vectors, and finding the magnitude of a vector.  
Homework 01 Objective: Write a program which replicates the final game of a famous price related game show. In this version, a “Showcase” contains exactly 5 unique randomly selected prizes. The user must guess the sum of the prizes within $1,300 below or equal to the sum in order to win.  
Homework 02 Objective: Write a program in which the user loads and searches a database of video games. Users should have the option to search games by their title, their console, or both based on partial matches. In addition, the user can use the wildcard “*” to indicate they want all results from either titles or consoles. The user should have the option to both print the results of the search via the console or print the results to a file.  
Homework 03 Objective: Write a program in which the user can manage a collection of tasks. Each task has an associated action a priority. The tasks must be organized into a collection of different lists based on their priority value, where the highest priority is 0 and the lowest is 4.  
Homework 04 Objective: Write a program that simulates a robot running a queue of commands to move around a board with obstacles.  

CSCE 145 Algorithmic I w Hoskins:  
A Below Average Winter Objective: Write a program that takes in temperatures for 10 days and stores it in an array. Find the average temperature for those 10 days, and then print the number of days and the temperatures that were strictly below the average.   
Fleet of Vehicles Objective:  Use classes and inheritance to create a vehicle system managing system.  
Rock Paper Scissors Objective: Write a program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between a human and a computer opponent in best 2 out of 3 rounds.
